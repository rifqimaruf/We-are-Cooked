# 🍣 We are Cooked

This is a multiplayer cooking game inspired by games like "Overcooked" but with a focus on sushi preparation. The game is built using Python with Pygame for the client interface and uses socket programming for network communication.  

## 🍥 Gameplay

- Players control a specific ingredient (like Salmon, Tuna, Rice, etc.)
- When players move and collide within a fusion station, their ingredients can combine to create sushi recipes
- Successfully creating recipes earns points based on the recipe's price
- The game has different recipe levels (1-4) with increasing complexity and value

## 🕹️ How to Play
- Players can move using **Arrow Keys**
- Each players carry a single ingredient
- You can change your ingredient by going to the **Enter Station** (labeled green) and pressing **Enter**
- Players can fuse within a **Fusion Station** (Labeled Red) to fuse into a recipe
- If that was a valid recipe, points are awarded based on the recipe's price
- The game has a timer and displays current orders to fulfill
- There are limited time **Doorprize Events**, claim free prizes!

## 🔧 Technical Breakdown (For Contributions)
1. Network Architecture:
   - Server manages the game state and broadcasts updates to all clients
   - Clients send movement commands to the server
   - The server processes player movements, recipe combinations, and doorprize 
interactions

2. Game State Management:
   - The GameState class tracks player positions, ingredients, orders, score, 
and timer
   - The server regularly checks for recipe combinations and doorprize 
interactions
   - State updates are broadcast to all clients at regular intervals

3. Client Rendering:
   - The client uses Pygame to render the game state
   - Visual effects and sound effects enhance the gameplay experience
   - The client handles user input and sends commands to the server

4. Game Phases:
   - Start screen (lobby) where players wait for the game to begin
   - Playing phase where players fulfill orders and collect points
   - End screen showing the final score
